# README GENERATOR

## Badge

// Still to debug the code to render the badge

## Description
An app that quickly and easily creates a high quality README file by using a command line application to generate one.  This allows the developer to devote more time to working on the project.
    
## Motivation
To save when drafting a README.md file as one is required for every project repo.
    
## Problem
It saves time and avoids missing an important aspect of the README documentation.

## Tests

    
## Future Upgrades
It would be an upgrade to have some of the more repetitive responses saved (such as License chosen and Contact details) as this would save even more time for the developer.
